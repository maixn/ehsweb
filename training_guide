From Emma and Karen,

Please see below from Emma. She has approved changes to the text on the Training Course Selection Guide page.

1.	Please add this text below the title “Help me find my course”: Click on the each section to read descriptions of job duties and job hazards. Check the box next to each description that relates to your job. When finished, click FIND to see a list of required and recommended safety training courses that can be printed or emailed.

2.	Please remove the text at the bottom of the page that reads “From the options above, select all the conditions that apply.”

Thank you.

Karen
